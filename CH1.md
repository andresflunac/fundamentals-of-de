# Chapter 1: Data Engineering Described
## What's Data Engineering?
- Dats enginering has existed in some form since companies started doing things with data, and came into sharp focus alongside the rise of data science in 2010.
- Data engineering is the development, implementation, and maintenance of systems and processes that take raw data and produce high quality, consistent information.
- A data engineer manages the data engineering lifecycle, beginning with getting data from source systems and ending with serving data for use cases.
- We view the present as a golden age of data lifecycle management. Data engineers managing the data engineering lifecycle have better tools and techniques than ever before.
- Data engineers juggle a lot of complex moving parts and must constantly optimize along the axes of cost, agility, scalability, simplicity, reuse and interoperability.
- Data engineers are now more focused on balancing the simplest and most cost-effective, best-of-breed services that deliver value to the business.
## History of Data Engineering
- Evolution od the Data Engineer
    - 1980 - 2000: From data warehousing to the web:
        - 1970: Business data warehouse
        - 1990: Enterprise data warehouse
        - Expensive, monolithic and heavily licensed infrastructure
    - Early 2000: The birth of contemporary data engineering
        - Need of systems that must be cost effective, scalable, available and reliable (Store and read TBs of data)
        - 2003: Google's File System
        - 2004: Map Reduce paper
    - 2000 - 2010: Big data engineering
        - 2005: Yahoo employee creates Hadoop: HDFS + MapReduce framework
        - 2007 - 2008: Hadoop early adopters. Solutions to reduce complexity of MapReduce jobs. Creation of new solutions (Hive, Cassandra, HBase)
        - 2008 - 2012: Rise of Hadoop vendors (Cloudera, Hortonworks)
        - Big data engineers had to be proficient in software development and low-level infrastructure hacking
    - The 2020s: Engineering for the data lifecycle
        > With the greater abstraction and simplification, a data lifecycle engineer is no longer encumbered by the glory details of yesterday's big data frameworks. While data engineers maintain skills in low level programming and use these things as required, they increasingly find their role focused on things in higher value: Security, data management, DataOps, data architecture, orchestration, and general data lifecycle management.
## Data Engineering based on data maturity level        
- Data Maturity and the Data Engineer: The level of complexity within a company depends a great deal on the company's data maturity
    - Starting with data: Get buy-in and define data architecture
        - Balance between quick wins and technical debt
        - Get out and talk to people / don't work in siloes
        - Don't box youself with unnecessary technical complexity
        - Build custom solutions and code where this creates a competetive advantage
    -  Scaling with data: Adopting DevOps and DataIOps practices
        - Any tech decision should be driven by the value it delivers to users
        - Main bottleneck for scaling: people
        - Tech organization how to consume and leverage data
    - Leading with data: Automation and "enterprisey" aspects of data
## Data Engineering Business responsibilities: 
- Know to communicate with non-technical people
- Understand how to scope and gather business and product requirements
- Understand the cultural foundations of Agile, DevOps, DataOps
- Control costs
- Learn continuously
- A successful data engineer always zooms out to understand the **big picture** and how to achieve outsized value for the business. 
- Communication is vital, both for tech and non tech people. Success or failure is rarely a technology issue.
- Knowing how to navigate an organization, scope and gather requirements, control costs, and co ntinously learn will set you apart from the DEs who rely solely on their technical abilities to carry their career.
## About Data Engineering Tech Skills
- Even in a more abstracted world, software engineering best practices provide a competetive advantage, and data engineers who can dive into deep architectural details of a codebase give their companies an edge when specific technical needs arise.
- A data engineer should work together with software engineers to understand the applications that generate data, the volume, frequency, and format of the generated data and anything else that will impact the DE lifecycle, such as data security and regulatory compliance.
